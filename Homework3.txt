The swift framework implements Reference Types and Value Types. Swift allows us to define 
custom value types by using struct and enum keywords, class, delegate and interface are 
for reference types. Primitive types, like byte, char, short, int and long are value 
types, but developers can’t define custom primitive types. In swift primitive types are 
also value types, but does not expose a possibility to define custom value types for 
developers.

Value Types and Reference Types are very different in terms of performance 
characteristics:

-  Every instance of a reference type has two extra fields used internally by CLR.
-  Value Types have no hidden overhead, so they have better data locality.
-  Reference Types are managed by GC. It tracks the references, offers fast allocation 
   and expensive, non-deterministic deallocation.
-  Whenever a reference is required value types are being boxed. Boxing is expensive, 
   adds an extra pressure for the GC. You should avoid boxing if you can.
-  By using generic constraints we can avoid boxing and even de-virtualize interface 
   method calls for Value Types!
-  Value Types are passed to and returned from methods by Value. So by default, they are 
   copied all the time.
